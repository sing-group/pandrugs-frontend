## What is PanDrugs?<a name="what-is-pandrugs"></a>
PanDrugs is a bioinformatics platform to prioritize anticancer drug treatments using individual genomics data. **This prioritization is performed through the intersection of two scores: the DScore and the GScore**.

## What does the DScore represent?<a name="dscore"></a>
The **DScore** measures the **suitability of the treatment** according to the drug indication and status, type of drug-gene association and curation level of the sources. It **ranges from -1 to 1**, with the negative values corresponding to resistance and the positive values corresponding to sensitivity.

You can find more details regarding the DScore computation [here](#!/help#gscore-and-dscore-concept-and-calculation).

## What does the GScore represent?<a name="gscore"></a>
The **GScore** measures the **biological relevance of a gene in the tumoral process and its druggability**. It is estimated according to gene essentiality, tumor vulnerability, relevance of the gene in cancer, its druggability level, the biological impact of mutations, the frequency of gene alterations and their clinical implications. The GScore **ranges from 0 to 1**.

You can find more details regarding the GScore computation [here](#!/help#gscore-and-dscore-concept-and-calculation).

## What are the Best Therapeutic Candidates?<a name="best-therapeutic-candidates"></a>
PanDrugs provides a prioritized list of candidate drugs considering the DScore and GScore values. **Those therapies supported by DScores and GScores closer to 1 will have higher evidence of their effectiveness in cancer treatment and will be considered as Best Therapeutic Candidates**. 

The thresholds for labelling a drug as Best Therapeutic Candidate are DScore = 0.7 and GScore = 0.6.

<!-- ## Which are PanDrugsdb sources?<a name="pandrugsdb-sources"></a>
You can check all sources used to build PanDrugsdb in [sources](#!/sources) page. -->

## What inputs does PanDrugs accept?<a name="pandrugs-inputs"></a>
For more information, please check the [help](#!/help#query-options) page.

<!-- ## What information does the report contain?<a name="report-info"></a> 
For more information, please check the [help](#!/help) page. -->

## Can I input a VCF containing only germline variants?<a name="only-germline"></a>
Currently, **PanDrugs requires that your VCF contains somatic variants** in order to generate a drug ranking. Germline variants are used to annotate ranked drugs according to the recommendations provided by the [Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)](https://cpicpgx.org), which are retrieved via [PharmCAT](https://pharmcat.org).

## How do I cite PanDrugs?<a name="citation"></a>
When citing our application, please refer to **PanDrugs publication:**

E. Pi침eiro-Y치침ez et al. (2018) [PanDrugs: a novel method to prioritize anticancer drug treatments according to individual genomic data.](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-018-0546-1) Genome Medicine. Volume 10:41. ISSN: 1756-994X.

## Which license does PanDrugs use?<a name="license"></a>
GPLv3.

## Can I use PanDrugs for medical advice?<a name="medical-advice"></a>
PanDrugs is exclusively intended for research purposes and academic use. **It should not be used for medical or professional advice**.

## Can I use PanDrugs with non-cancer data?<a name="non-cancer-data"></a>
PanDrugs has been designed to prioritize drugs using cancer genomics data. Nevertheless, genomics data from patients suffering other conditions (e.g. Alzheimer's Disease) could be used for exploratory purposes. In such cases, please keep in mind that the **GScore is biased towards cancer-related genes**. Thus, we recommend you to **rank the results considering only the DScore**.

## Can I use PanDrugs for commercial purposes?<a name="commercial-use"></a>
PanDrugs is exclusively intended for research purposes and academic use. **In case you are interested in a collaboration, please contact the principal investigator [F치tima Al-Shahrour](mailto:falshahrour@cnio.es)**.
