    This plot shows the percentage of patients in different tumor types from TCGA study with druggable alterations
    according to the suggestions by PanDrugs based on punctual genetic alterations. Each bubble represents a druggable
    alteration and the gene score is the highest one among the computed for the altered gene in each patient. For each
    gene, the highest availability of the treatment is selected to establish the status label druggability of the gene
    (e.g. Approved in same tumor type is preferable before approved in other tumor types). Only alterations with a gene
    score greater or equal than 0.6 are considered. A minimum percentage of 2 is required for the bubble to be
    represented.

    This plot shows the percentage of patients in different tumor types from TCGA study that would be treated according
    to PanDrugs suggestions based on punctual genetic alterations. Each bubble represents a treatment with a particular
    drug and the drug score is the highest one among the computed for each patient that could be treated with that
    compound. Only alterations with a gene score greater or equal than 0.6 are considered. Representation shows the top
    100 cases according to the percentage of patients in each TCGA cohort.
