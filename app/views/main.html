<h3>What is PanDrugs?</h3>
      <p class="db_desc"><strong>PanDrugs</strong> provides a bioinformatics platform
<strong>to prioritize anticancer drug treatments according to individual multi-omics
data</strong>. PanDrugs current version integrates data from <strong>24</strong> primary
sources and supports <strong>74130</strong> drug-target associations obtained
from <strong>4642</strong> genes and <strong>14658</strong> unique compounds.</p>

    <p class="db_desc">
      <strong>Data input:</strong>
    <ol type="a">
      <li><strong>VCF</strong> file: for somatic and germinal variation analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>RNK</strong> file: for users' pre-ranked gene lists.</li>
      <li><strong>TSV</strong> file: for CNV analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>gene lists.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>drug queries.</strong></li>
    </ol></p>
    <p class="db_desc">Please note PanDrugs terminology for druggable genes:
      <ol type="I">
        <li><strong>Direct targets</strong>: Genes that contribute to a disease phenotype and can be directly
        targeted by a drug (e.g. <i>BRAF</i> is a direct target for Vemurafenib).</li>
        <li><strong>Biomarkers</strong>: Genes whose genetic status is associated with a drug response 
        but are not the drug target themselves (e.g. <i>BRCA</i>-mutated
        cancers responding to PARP inhibitors).</li>
        <li><strong>Pathway members</strong>: Genes found within the pathway and downstream 
          of a given undruggable gene (e.g. patients with mutations in <i>TSC1/2</i>
          respond to a downstream inhibition of the mTOR pathway).</li>
          <!-- 
            <li><strong>Gene dependencies</strong>: Genes with a dependency relationship with a given undruggable gene (e.g.).</li> 
          -->

    <h3>PanDrugs workflow</h3>
    <p>PanDrugs considers drug indication and status, type of drug-gene association 
    and curation level of the sources to calculate the <strong>Drug Score
    (DScore)</strong>. <strong>The Gene Score (GScore)</strong> is
    estimated according to gene essentiality, tumor vulnerability, relevance of the gene 
    in cancer, its druggability level, the biological impact of mutations, the frequency of 
    gene alterations and their clinical implications. PanDrugs resolves the 
    <em>Best Therapeutic Candidates</em> based on both the <strong>DScore</strong> 
    and the <strong>GScore</strong>.</p>

        <p>To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, PanDrugs uses several technical

          Input VCFs are deleted right after execution. However, data analyzed with PanDrugs 
          are stored in our private servers. This data includes annotations for somatic

          that it will be completely and permanently removed from PanDrugs servers. Files 
          are not shared with third parties.</p> <p> We ensure that data and results are 
          kept at least 1 week for guest requests and at least 6 months for authenticated
